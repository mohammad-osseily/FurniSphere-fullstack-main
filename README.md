> FurniSphere offers an immersive 360-degree view of furniture, allowing users to explore products in stunning detail. AI technology enables dynamic rearrangement of 3D models, while machine learning recommends products based on user preferences. It's not just shoppingâ€”it's a personalized, interactive experience.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to browse the furniture collection, so I can find pieces that suit my taste and needs.
- As a user, I want to view the furniture in 360 degrees, so I can see the product from all angles and better understand its design and quality.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit in the space of the room.

### Admin Stories

- As an admin, I want to update the order status, so I can keep customers informed about the progress of their orders.
- As an admin, I want to update user profiles, so I can manage customer information and provide better service.
- As an admin, I want to edit the 3D model positions, so I can ensure the furniture items are displayed accurately in the virtual space.
- As an admin, I want to add new products to the furniture collection, so the catalog remains up to date with the latest offerings.

###  FurniSphere is built using the following technologies:

- Next.js & Three.js: The frontend is developed using Next.js and Three.js to create an interactive and dynamic 3D space tour, enabling users to explore the environment with enhanced performance and server-side rendering capabilities.
- Laravel & MySQL: The backend utilizes Laravel for server-side logic and application structure, with MySQL as the database to manage data efficiently. This setup supports robust operations and seamless integration with the frontend.
